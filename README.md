# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022 in C#/Kotlin/JavaScript/Python (whichever tickles my fancy). A few self-imposed rules that I mostly follow:

* Stick to standard libs (e.g., no nuget/npm/pip)
* Prefer a functional approach with higher order functions over impure functions
* No self-made utils, just code from scratch
